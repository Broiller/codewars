/*
Description:
You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening?
Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.
These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:
hello - english
ciao - italian
salut - french
hallo - german
hola - spanish
ahoj - czech republic
czesc - polish
By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!!
PS. you can assume the input is a string. PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test)
PS. regex should be case insensitive to pass the tests
*/

function validateHello(greetings) {
  
 let res =/(hello|ciao|salut|hallo|hola|ahoj|czesc)/i.test(greetings) 
  return res
}
