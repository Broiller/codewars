Description:
Debug celsius converter
Your friend is traveling abroad to the United States so he wrote a program to convert fahrenheit to celsius. Unfortunately his code has some bugs.
Find the errors in the code to get the celsius converter working properly.
To convert fahrenheit to celsius:
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)
Remember that typically temperatures in the current weather conditions are given in whole numbers. It is possible for temperature sensors to report temperatures with a higher accuracy such as to the nearest tenth. Instrument error though makes this sort of accuracy unreliable for many types of temperature measuring sensors.

function weatherInfo (temp) {
   var celsius = (temp - 32) * (5/9)
  if (celsius > 0)
    return (celsius + " is above freezing temperature")
  else
    return (celsius + " is freezing temperature")
}

function convertToCelsius (temperature) {
  var celsius = (temperature - 32) * (5/9)
  return temperature
}
