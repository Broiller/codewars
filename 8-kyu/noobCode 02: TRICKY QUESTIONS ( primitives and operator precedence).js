Description:
1 < 2 < 3 === true, right? but can
3 < 2 < 1 === true, too??
Here's your task: write a function greaterThanLessThan with three arguments (a,b,c) that returns a boolean (true or false), such that
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
returns true, as does
a = 3
b = 2
c = 1
Note: arguments do not necessarily have to be in strict ascending or descending order, as indicated by the example test cases.
Check out the included test cases - not all arguments are going to return true! It's up to you to figure out which ones do and which ones don't.
Hint: This challenge is a LOT easier than it might seem at first. Don't focus too much on building functions - just pay attention to precedence.
Best of luck!
Need some pointers? Brush up on your operator precedence here and you'll figure it out:

Don't forget your primitives either:

function greaterThanLessThan (a,b,c) {
return a<b<c
}
