Description:
Given the moleculer mass of two molecules ( M1 and M2 ), their masses present ( m1 and m2 ) in a vessel of volume ( V ) at a specific temperature ( T ). Find the total pressure exerted by the molecules ( Ptotal ) .
input
Six values :
m1
m2
M1
M2
V
T
output
One value :
Ptotal
notes
Units for each of the following are given as under :
m1 = gram
m2 = gram
M1 = gram.mole-1
M2 = gram.mole-1
V = dm3
T = Celcius
Ptotal = atmpspheric pressure (atm)
Remember : Temperature is given in Celcius while SI unit is Kelvin (K)
0 Celcius = 273.15Kelvin
The gas constant (R) has value of 0.082dm3.atm.K-1.mol-1

function solution(M1, M2, m1, m2, V, T) {
  M1 = (m1 * 0.001) / M1;
  M2 = (m2 * 0.001) / M2;
  T = T + 273.15;
  let R = 0.082;

  return (((M1 + M2) * R * T) / V) * 1000;
