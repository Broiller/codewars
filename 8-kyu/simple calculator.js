/*
Description:
You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.
Your function will accept three arguments:
The first and second argument will be numbers.
The third argument will represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.
Example:
calculator(1,2,"+"); //=> result will be 3
if the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown value" must be returned.
Example:
calculator(1,2,"&"); //=> result will be "unknown value"
calculator(1,"k","*"); //=> result will be "unknown value"
Good luck!
*/

function calculator(a,b,sign){
 try {
    return eval(`${a} ${sign} ${b}`)
  } catch (e) {
    return 'unknown value'
  }

}
